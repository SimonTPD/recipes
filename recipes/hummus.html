        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hummus is another amazing Mediteranean dish. A mashup
            whose principal ingredient is chick peas, it's
            not just nutritious, but also delicious with pita.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chickpeas (or garbanzo beans) are the base for 
                hummus. The softened beans break down into a 
                smooth paste. You can use canned or home-cooked 
                chickpeas in our recipe. I use them 
                interchangeably, giving home-cooked chickpeas 
                a slight edge regarding flavor. Here's my method 
                for cooking dried chickpeas.</li>
            <li>Tahini is a paste made from ground sesame seeds, 
                making hummus taste incredible. You can buy 
                tahini, or you can make it yourself. To make 
                hummus that's 100% from scratch, we use homemade 
                tahini (it's easy, I promise). Here's our tahini 
                recipe with a video showing how to make it.</li>
            <li>Fresh lemon juice is essential for great hummus, 
                so skip the bottled juice and buy fresh lemons — 
                1 large or 2 medium lemons should do.</li> 
            <li>Fresh garlic adds a little spice and zest. 
                I add one small clove and find it's just right. 
                Add more for a garlicky kick, or substitute 
                for more mellow roasted garlic and make roasted 
                garlic hummus. Here's how we roast garlic.</li>   
            <li>Ground cumin and salt help to make it taste 
                amazing, and the ground cumin adds a little 
                more spice and richness.</li>   
            <li>Olive oil makes the texture of the hummus 
                luxurious. We also drizzle over the top of the 
                swirly hummus when serving. I like fruity, 
                light-flavored olive oils when making hummus.</li>     
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of a food processor, combine the 
                tahini and lemon juice and process for 1 minute. 
                Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then 
                process for 30 seconds more. This extra time 
                helps “whip” or “cream” the tahini, making the 
                hummus smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a 
                1/2 teaspoon of salt to the whipped tahini and 
                lemon juice. Process for 30 seconds, scrape the 
                sides and bottom of the bowl, and then process 
                for another 30 seconds or until well blended.</li>
            <li>Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor 
                and process for 1 minute. Scrape the sides and 
                bottom of the bowl, then add the remaining 
                chickpeas and process them until thick and 
                relatively smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>The hummus will likely be too thick and still 
                have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, slowly 
                add 2 to 3 tablespoons of cold water or 
                aquafaba with the food processor turned on until 
                you reach the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a 
                drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of paprika, 
                sumac, or Za'atar.</li>
            <li>Store homemade hummus in an airtight container 
                and refrigerate for up to one week. Freeze, 
                covered with a thin layer of olive oil, for 
                up to one month.</li>
        </ol>
