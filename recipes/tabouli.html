        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tabouli is a wholesome dish very popular in 
            Mediteranean cuisine. It represents the area it comes
            from very well, in terms of the diverse delicious
            ingredients it contains and with its fresh and slightly
            tangy taste.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Â½ cup fine bulgur wheat</li>
            <li>4 firm Roma tomatoes, very finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 English cucumber (hothouse cucumber), very finely 
                chopped</li>
            <li>2 bunches parsley, part of the stems removed, 
                washed and well-dried, very finely chopped</li>
            <li>12-15 fresh mint leaves, stems removed, washed, 
                well-dried, very finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 green onions, white and green parts, 
                very finely chopped</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoon lime juice (lemon juice, 
                if you prefer)</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoon Early Harvest extra virgin 
                olive oil</li>
            <li>Romaine lettuce leaves to serve, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the bulgur wheat and soak it in water for 
                5-7 minute. Drain very well (squeeze the bulgur wheat 
                by hand to get rid of any excess water). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Very finely chop the vegetables, herbs and 
                green onions as indicated above. Be sure to place 
                the tomatoes in a colander to drain excess juice.</li>
            <li>Place the chopped vegetables, herbs and green onions 
                in a mixing bowl or dish. Add the bulgur and season 
                with salt. Mix gently.</li>
            <li>Now add the the lime juice and olive oil and 
                mix again.</li>
            <li>For best results, cover the tabouli and refrigerate 
                for 30 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter. 
                If you like, serve the tabouli with a side of pita
                and romaine lettuce leaves, which act as wraps or 
                "boats" for the tabouli.</li>
        </ol>
