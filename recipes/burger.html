        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div class="main-ctnr">
            <p class="first-p last-p">There is not much to say about the hamburger. Its
                reputation precedes it. It's an American staple
                and the picture can already bring the taste
                to your mouth.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="main-ctnr">
            <ul class="first-p last-p"> 
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>            
                <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>           
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>           
                <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>       
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="main-ctnr">
            <ol class="first-p last-p">
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and 
                    lightly oil grate.</li>
                <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a 
                    medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with 
                    your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
                <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
                <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. 
                    Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or 
                    to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer 
                    inserted into the center should read at least 
                    160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
